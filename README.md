Hands-free Mouse

An arduino based cap-like device that simply connects to your computer using UART over
bluetooth or USB. It emulates mouse cursor movements using a python script based on your head
movement and mouse click events using tongue and touch sensors.

Kindly edit the COM port to your bluetooth port paired with the device or to the USB the arduino is connected.
